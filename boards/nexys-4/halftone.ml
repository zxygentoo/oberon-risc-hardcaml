(* Public API and behaviour spec live in [halftone.mli].

   Implementation notes (v2 — the generality rework).

   The decision function is ordered dithering's per-output-bit core: bit =
   (lut[pix[row_base + sx]] > thr[thr_row][ox & 63]). v1 baked the 320x200 → fullscreen
   geometry (slot tables + a row-map ROM); v2 uploads ALL policy:

   - the row map (768 x 22 CPU-written RAM at [thr_base + rowmap_off]): rect-relative
     output row -> [{thr_row[6], row_base[16]}]. Read at request-accept (async array +
     output register — the v1 registered-read timing lesson), so both fields are valid
     from cycle 1 on. Vertical geometry lives ENTIRELY in this table: no vertical DDA, no
     multiplier.

   - the threshold map (64x64 bytes, four byte-lane 1024x8 BRAMs at [thr_base]): uploaded
     VERBATIM (the v1 slot-quad packing died with the slot structure). Read per beat as
     one aligned 4-byte group: the four thresholds of output px 4t..4t+3 are bytes
     [{thr_row, 32*(col&1) + 4t .. +3}] — lane k serves px 4t+k exactly.

   - horizontal geometry: the XNUM/XDEN/XOFF registers driving an output-pixel DDA (spec
     in the mli, frozen); XNUM >= XDEN, so sx advances at most 1 per output px.

   The compose FSM (one word = 32 output px, 2 px/clock over a 2-word sliding source
   window; all claimed words take the same 21-clk schedule):

   cnt 0 idle; an accepted CLAIMED request latches [{col, par}], clears acc, resets the
   DDA at the rect row's first word (sx := XOFF, xacc := XDEN — mid-row words CARRY
   sx/xacc from the previous word: Video's raster-order request stream is the contract),
   reads the row map, cnt := 1. cnt 1: a0 = row_base + sx known — prime wbase := a0>>2, ob
   := a0&3; present pixel read a0>>2. cnt 2: capture w0; present read a0>>2 + 1. cnt 3:
   capture w1; present the beat-0/1 threshold group and the prefetch wbase+2. cnt 4..19:
   beats 0..15, two pixels each — byte(ob_k) from [{w0,w1}] -> its own async LUT replica
   -> compare against the threshold pair (even beat: group bytes 0,1; odd: 2,3; a group is
   read at the odd cnt before its pair and holds two cycles) -> the pair ORed into
   acc[2t+1:2t]; the 2-step DDA chain advances (xacc, ob, sx); if ob crossed into w1 (ob
   >= 4) the window slides: w0 := w1, w1 := the prefetched word, wbase += 1. The prefetch
   address is wbase + 2, PURE REGISTERED STATE — at <= 2 source bytes per beat two slides
   are never consecutive, so the in-flight word is always the one a slide pulls in (the
   first build's WNS -1.382 path, the 4-px DDA chain reaching the BRAM address port, is
   structurally gone). cnt 20: vid_ack; cnt := 0. Latency 21 clk at any scale — inside
   Video's ~2-group prefetch budget (~59 clk at 60 MHz) and its ~29.5-clk sustained
   spacing.

   Unclaimed requests never start the FSM (the board mux forwards Framebuf on [~claim]);
   every accepted request still updates the vblank tracker, the frame counter, and the
   geometry-shadow latch (vblank entry = the accept whose fetch row is a blanking row, y
   >= 768 — the prefetch keeps requesting through blanking, so frame position costs no CDC
   and no Video change).

   Verification, four rungs here (the DOOM repo's doom_sim golden stays the fifth): the
   DDA ≡ the v1 slot tables at 16/5; a full-frame FNV hash of the reference model at the
   DOOM configuration ≡ the gcc-compiled shipped dither.c (the v1 constant — it must not
   move across this rework); a random differential hardware ≡ model through the real
   write/read ports over random GEOMETRY (rects, scales, row maps) as well as random
   tables; and a write-path/mode/status/shadow-latch test. *)

   fb + 767*32, -32) and FNV-1a-64-hashes the frame in (y asc, col asc) word order, 4 LE
   bytes per word. THE CONSTANT MUST NOT MOVE across the v2 rework: same pixels, through
   uploaded tables + the DDA instead of baked ROMs.

   Rung 2 — hardware ≡ model differential through the real write/read ports, over random
   GEOMETRY (rects, scales, XOFF, per-row-random row maps) as well as random tables;
   unclaimed fetches (outside the rect, blanking rows) must never ack; shadow registers
